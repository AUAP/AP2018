Again...this is the unstable/messy notes for class02: Having *Fun* with Basics

Agenda:
- Artwork showcase: what might be the notion of fun?
- Basic structure: HTML, CSS, JS
- Coordinate System
- Basic syntax: setup(), draw(), createCanvas(), background()
- Think in terms of a canvas
- Basic orientation/calculation: pixel, width, height, use of variables and basic arithmetic operators 
- Errors + different types of errors: print(), console.log()
- In-class ex: Grid paper drawing
- Shapes drawing
- The concept of peer-tutoring
- Tasks for next week

### Artwork showcase and discussion: what might be the notion of fun?

  - Interflight is a playful and artistic installation where users can interact with small robotic interfaces, at the same time these robots scroll and move on a touch-screen located on the floor of a cage where is displayed an interactive map.
  - In-class task: Take a look at the work and description, discuss how this work may express and address the notion of fun.

### Basic structure: HTML, CSS, JS

- HTML: a markup language that use tags to define elements within a document. It is more a structure that defines, organizes and governs a document  e.g the title, the language, the format, etc. It is a language, a human readable language that also instructs a browser to render the (html) tags, in which it defines how images, text or any other multimedia forms are displayed in web browsers.

### The concept of peer-tutoring
  - 9 groups [here](https://etherpad.net/p/ap2018)
  - The concept of presenters and respondents
  - The first one for next week: push(), pop()
  
### Tasks for next week
  - the concept of mini exercises
  - mini_ex2: [A fun drawing](https://github.com/AUAP/AP2018/blob/master/all_miniex/mini_ex2.md)
  - peer-tutoring: push(), pop()

### The concept of fun
  - Using the example of Love Letter Generator: "the fun of 'geekiness,' wit, the humour and extravagance of mathematical geniuses and their material processes of thinking and making" (p.2)
  - "Humour here is indicative of the pleasure of breakthrough, of thought experimentation, of unconstrained and purposeless but intense and curious and materially specific enquiry." (p. 2)
  - fun "unites pleasure and wit with affective engagement, conceptual, social and cultural practices and vivid, disturbing and inventive modes of thinking and making" (p.2)
  - hacker culture: homour+technical ability (p. 3)
  - open up criticism and thinking
  - "Fun in computing as a mode of thinking, making, experiencing is about a mode of reasoning, and as such it convolutes the question of rationalism, the qualities of logical reasoning, the autonomy of computation and relates to the sensibilities and creative drives of computing" (p. 4)
  - "Fun, within and with logical reason, relates to paradox, the incomputable" (p. 4)
  - "Fun that includes pleasure, humour and play, but also paradox, incongruity and pain, and that takes part in the construction, maintence and use of those computational machines through which creative populations produce value" (p. 5)
  - the concept of affect - "bringing the affective into computing or the structures of code and computing practices functioning aesthetically (Goffey)" (p. 5)
  - "Fun here is related to abstraction and notation, formal logic and experience, singularity and repetition, contingency and practice, incomputability and paradox, to the question of where computational processes start and end and which assemblages they construct and are part of, to the subjects and experience of and by computing, to how algorithms model and are modelled by the world and how they couple with other processes, within and outside computation, to the cultures and aesthetics of software, to its building upon itself, to its politics, desires and legal projects." (p. 5)
  - fun as a method and as a concept (p. 8) -> an onto-epistemological enactive device. -> explore various scale of fun that "creates conditions i nwhich forms of critical, political and collective expression of desiring fun can be seen and given voice." (p. 8)
  - fun relates to "forms of reasoning and the becoming of computing; it is experiential, affective and collective; it is a desiring process and a sensibility, a mode of thinking and of working; a horizon, an idea, a passion and an action." (p. 11)
  - how might fun moves away from the experience of a human user and "look for fun that belongs to programming structures, practices and real-world contexts"?
