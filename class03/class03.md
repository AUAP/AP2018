### Time/Throbber

*What is the notion of time related to contemporary software/network culture?*
"Loading webpages, waiting for social media feeds, streaming videos and content, are mundane activities in contemporary culture. Such mundane activity includes network-connected devices that transmit and distribute data across multiple sites — referred to as data. In these scenes, data are constantly perceived as a stream (Berry 2011, 3; 2012, 388; 2013, n.p; Fuller 2003, 52), indicating characteristics of vast  volume, speed of update, continuous flow and delivery. The concept of streams characterises the Internet rather than web pages (Berry 2011, 143). The web is a dynamic stream of information in which users can participate and follow. It is fast-changing and generative, data records are continuously updated and executed in a manner in which an end cannot be foreseen. There is a temporal dimension to the data stream and in today’s networked communication data streams indicate events that are regarded as instantaneous in capitalised economies. The now that we are experiencing through perceptible streams is entangled with computational logic."  (Soon, 2017, p. 89)

### Artwork showcase

Asterisk Painting by John P. Bell

Artist description: Asterisk Painting is programmed to create a series of asterisks by repeatedly printing the number of milliseconds that have passed since the painting started. If left to run by itself it will do so; however, when started on a system with other threads running in the background delays external to my artwork may make the asterisks look more like spots and the painting may resemble the work of certain other overly-litigious artists.
