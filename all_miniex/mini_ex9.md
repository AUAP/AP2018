# Weekly mini ex9: due week 16, Monday night - Flow Chart
 
**Objectives:**
1. To acquire the ability to decompose/break down a computer program into definable parts
2. To organize and structure a computer program through a flow chart
3. To understand flowchart as a means for communication and planning 

**Tasks:**
1. This mini exercise is divided into two parts. First is individual and second is a group work (your whole study group)
2. Make sure you have read the text by Ed Finn: 
- Ed Finn, “What is an Algorithm,” in What Algorithms Want, MIT Press, 2017, pp. 15-56. (in blackboard - take some time to read it)
3. For the **individual** work:
  - Look at your previous mini exercises and select the most technically complex one
  - Draw an individual flow chart to present the program (Pay attention to: which items you select to present through a flow chart)
  - In the readme file:
    - Attach the flowchart image
    - You need to have a hyperlink that links to your chosen mini_ex folder. 
    - What is the difficulty in drawing the flow chart? 
4. For the **group** work:
  - Get together as a study group and brainstrom the forthcoming program for the final project 
  - In the readme file:
    - Present two different ideas with two different flow charts (it is important to think about the balance between simplicity and complexity. How can we get a sense of what's your program about?)
    - What might be the possible technical challenges for the two ideas and how are you going to solve them?  
    - Individual: How is this flow chart different from the one that you had in #2 (in terms of the role of a flow chart)? 
    - Individual: If you have to bring the concept of algorithms from flow charts to a wider cultural context, how would you reflect the notion of algorithms? (see if you could refer to the text and articule your thoughts?)
5. Create a readme file together (README.md) and upload to the mini_ex9 directory (see [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing the README). The readme file should contain the followings:
6. Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" on his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"
   (adjust the peer-feedback accordingly as this time you are not feedback the actual code/program, but something in a graphic form. The departure question would be: Do you understand the algorithms through a flow chart?)
