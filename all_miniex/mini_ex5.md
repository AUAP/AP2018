# Weekly mini ex5: due week 11, Monday night - Games with objects

**Objective:**
- To implement a class-based object oriented sketch via abstracting and designing objects' properties and behaviors. 
- To reflect upon object orientation in the domain of digital culture.

**Tasks:**
1. Make sure you have read the text by Roger Lee: 
- Lee, Roger Y. *Software Engineering: A Hands-On Approach*. Springer, 2013. 17-24, 35-37 (Check Blackboard - ch. 2 Object-Oriented concepts)
2. Think of a simple game that you want to design and implement, what are the objects required? What are their properties and behaviors? At the most basic level, you need to use class-based object oriented approach to design your game components that can exhibit certain behaviors (that means you need to at least have a class, constructor and method). If you can master objects and classes, you *may* further work on a mini game (with basic rules) that works with data input and interactive devices (such as keyboard and mouse) that you have learned from previous class.
3. Take a look at some simple game projects for inspiration: (pls note that some of the projects are not implmented in the format of class-based object oriented programming)

4. Upload your game or game object sketch to your own Github account under a folder called **mini_ex5**. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser, and if it requires downloading other library or other devices, please specify in your readme file) 
5. Create a readme file (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex5 directory (see [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing the README). The readme file should contain the followings:
- A screenshot of your program
- A URL link to your program and run on a browser, see: https://rawgit.com/.
- Describe how does your game/game object works? 
- Describe how you program the objects and their related attributes and methods in your game.
- Based on Shiftman's videos, Lee's text and in-class lecture, what are the characteristics of object-oriented programming?
- Extend/connect your game project to wider digital culture context, can you think of a digital example and describe how complex details and operations are being abstracted and encapsulated?  
6. Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" on his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"

NB!: Feel Free to explore and experiment more syntax.

**What is peer-feedback?**
1. First you describe what is the work, what are the elements in the work? like what you have seen, what you have experienced and what syntax he/she has used.
2. What is the emphasis? What does the work express? What does this work say or mean to you? How would you interprete the work?
3. Do you like this program, and Why? and which aspect do you like the most? 
4. Provide suggestion for improvement or expansion of the program/thoughts
