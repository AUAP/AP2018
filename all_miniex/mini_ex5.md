# Weekly mini ex5: due week 11, Monday night - Games with objects

**Objective:**
- To implement an object-oriented game via designing objects and behaviors. 
- To reflect upon objects in the domain of digital culture.

**Tasks:**
1. Make sure you have read the text by Roger Lee: 
- Lee, Roger Y. *Software Engineering: A Hands-On Approach*. Springer, 2013. 17-38 (Check Blackboard - ch. 2 Object-Oriented concepts)
2. Building upon previous mini exercise that you have worked with data input and interactive devices, design a simple game with objects, behaviors and rules.  
3. Take a look at some simple game projects for inspiration:
- [p5.js coding challenge #31: Flappy Bird by Daniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXgA1d_E-jY)
- You may find [p5.play library](http://p5play.molleindustria.org/) useful
  - [p5.play library - examples, Pong](http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=pong.js)
  - [p5.play library - examples, Asteroid](http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=asteroids.js)
  - [p5.play library - examples, Breakout](http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=breakout.js)
4. Upload your game to your own Github account under a folder called **mini_ex5**. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser, and if it requires downloading other library or other devices, please specify in your readme file) 
5. Create a readme file (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex5 directory (see [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing the README). The readme file should contain the followings:
- A screenshot of your program
- A URL link to your program and run on a browser, see: https://rawgit.com/.
- Describe how does your game work? (from a user/player perspective)
- Describe how you program the objects and their related attributes and methods in your game.
- Extend your game project to wider digital culture context, can you think of a digital example and describe how complex details and operations are being abstracted?  
6. Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" on his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"

NB!: Feel Free to explore and experiment more syntax/data input devices.

**What is peer-feedback?**
1. First you describe what is the work, what are the elements in the work? like what you have seen, what you have experienced and what syntax he/she has used.
2. What is the emphasis? What does the work express? What does this work say or mean to you? How would you interprete the work?
3. Do you like this program, and Why? and which aspect do you like the most? 
4. Provide suggestion for improvement or expansion of the program/thoughts
