# Weekly mini ex2: due week 8, Monday night - Fun Drawing

**Objective:**
- To understand the notion of fun in both practice and theory by drawing upon Goriunova's text. 
- To experiment various computational drawing possibility.

**Tasks:**
1. Make sure you have read Goriunova's text: Goriunova, Oga. Fun and Software: Exploring Pleasure, Paradox and Pain in Computing. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014, pp.1-19. (check blackboard - Introduction)
2. In Goriunova's text p.4, she mentions"
```
Fun in computing as a mode of thinking, making, experiencing is about a mode of reasoning, and as such it convolutes the question of rationalism, the qualities of logical reason, the autonomy of computation and relates to the sensibilities and creative drives of computing. Fun is ambigous about the modes of knowledge and their distributed nature.
```

2. Study at least one syntax from the list of p5.js' [reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) (of course, it is always good to know more different syntax. Be curious!)
3. Familiar yourself with the reference structure: example, description, syntax and parameters (This becomes your essential and life-long skills for learning new syntax on your own)
4. Read and modify the sample code (the most basic level is changing the numbers), and produce a new sketch.
5. Upload your program/result to your own Github account under a folder called **mini_ex1**. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser) 
6. Create a readme file (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex1 directory (see [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing the README). The readme file should contain the followings:
- A screenshot about your program
- A URL link to your program and run on a browser, see: https://rawgit.com/
- Describe your first independent coding process
- How do you feel about read and write code? What might be the potential and possibilitiby of coding practice?
7. Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" on his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"

**What is peer-feedback?**
1. First you describe what is the work, what are the elements in the work? like what you have seen, what you have experienced and what syntax he/she has used.
2. What is the emphasis? What does the work express? What does this work say or mean to you? How would you interpretate the work?
3. Do you like this program, and Why? and which aspect do you like the most? 
4. Provide suggestion for improvement or expansion of the program
