# Weekly mini ex2: due week 8, Monday night - Fun Drawing

**Objective:**
- To understand the notion of fun in both practice and theory by drawing upon Goriunova's text. 
- To experiment various computational drawing possibility.

**Tasks:**
1. Make sure you have read Goriunova's text: Goriunova, Oga. Fun and Software: Exploring Pleasure, Paradox and Pain in Computing. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014, pp.1-19. (check blackboard - Introduction)
2. Based on your current programming skills, design a program that you think is addressing Goriunova's notion of fun.
3. Upload your program/result to your own Github account under a folder called **mini_ex2**. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser) 
4. Create a readme file (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex2 directory (see [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing the README). The readme file should contain the followings:
- A screenshot of your program
- A URL link to your program and run on a browser, see: https://rawgit.com/
- Describe your program and what you have used and learnt
- What is fun? To what extend your program addresses Goriunova's noton of fun? You need to at least use her text and reflect upon what does it means by "Fun in computing as a mode of thinking, making, experiencing is about a mode of reasoning" (p.4)
5. Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" on his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"

NB!: Feel Free to explore and experiment more syntax.

**What is peer-feedback?**
1. First you describe what is the work, what are the elements in the work? like what you have seen, what you have experienced and what syntax he/she has used.
2. What is the emphasis? What does the work express? What does this work say or mean to you? How would you interprete the work?
3. Do you like this program, and Why? and which aspect do you like the most? 
4. Provide suggestion for improvement or expansion of the program/thoughts
