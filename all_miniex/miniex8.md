# Weekly mini ex7: due week 14, Monday night - Working with APIs

**Objectives:**
1. To design and implement a program that utilizes web API(s). 
2. To learn to code and conceptualize a program collaboratively.
3. To reflect upon the processes of data parsing via API, paying attention to registration, availability/selection/manipulation of data 

**Get some inspiration here with different APIs source code**
  - [Open Weather with code example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecT42O6I_WI)
  - [Other weather API by apix with code example](https://p5js.org/examples/hello-p5-weather.html)
  - [New York times with code example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMne3LY4bks&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6a-SQiI4RtIwuOrLJGnel0r&index=9)
  - [Giphy images with code example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj8_w11MvH8&index=10&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6a-SQiI4RtIwuOrLJGnel0r)
  - [Wikipedia API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPz75gcHj18)
  - [Twitter API and Twitter Bot with code example](http://shiffman.net/a2z/twitter-bots/)
  - [Movie API with code example](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/cc-s16/movie-api-data/)
  - [Global statistic API with code example](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/cc-s16/inqubu-global-statistics-api/)
  - [Google map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)
  - [Search many other kinds of API](https://www.programmableweb.com/)
  - Refer to in-class material for Google Image search (w/ source code)
  
**for those APIs require OAuth, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). See what is Node [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF5_MPSNAtU&index=1&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6atTSxoRiVnSuOn6JHnq2yV) for 15.1 and 15.2**
 
**Tasks:**
1. First, take a deep breath. This mini exercise may require sometimes to do it. This is a group mini exercise. Form a group of 2 (max 3) based on your study group (best- different from last time).
2. Make sure you have read the text by Critical Software Thing and Albright Jonathan: 
  - Critical Software Thing. Executing. Draft. 2017. (check blackboard)
  - Albright, Jonathan. "[The Graph API: Key Points in the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica Debacle](https://medium.com/tow-center/the-graph-api-key-points-in-the-facebook-and-cambridge-analytica-debacle-b69fe692d747)". Medium, 2018. (check out the recent hot topic around Cambridge Analytica online)
3. This is a relatively complex exercise that requires you to:
  - Source for a Web API
  - Understand what are the available data: the data file format and API specification
  - Decide which data fields you want to choose to explore 
  - Utilize the web API and the coresponding data in your suggested program
  - Please reserve more time if you are getting data from other unfamiliar platforms, as the registration process can take a long time to do so. 
4. Upload your program to each individual Github account under a folder called **mini_ex8**. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser, and if it requires downloading other library or other devices, please specify in your readme file) 
5. Create a readme file together (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex8 directory (see [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing the README). The readme file should contain the followings:
- Who are you collaborate with?
- A screenshot of your program
- A title of your program
- A URL link to your program and run on a browser, see: https://rawgit.com/.
- What is the program about? which API have you used and why? 
- (individual)Can you describe and reflect your process of making this mini exercise in terms of acquiring, processing, using and representing data?
- (individual)Try to formulate a question in relation to web APIs or querying processes that you want to investigate further when you have more time.  

6. Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" on his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"

NB!: Feel Free to explore and experiment more syntax.

**What is peer-feedback?**
1. First you describe what is the work, what are the elements in the work? like what you have seen, what you have experienced and what syntax he/she has used.
2. What is the emphasis? What does the work express? What does this work say or mean to you? How would you interprete the work?
3. Do you like this program, and Why? and which aspect do you like the most? 
4. Provide suggestion for improvement or expansion of the program/thoughts
