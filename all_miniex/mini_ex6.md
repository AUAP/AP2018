# Weekly mini ex6: due week 12, Monday night - A generative program

**Objectives:**
- To implement a rule-based generative program from scratch.
- To strengthen the computational use of loops and conditional statements in a program.
- To reflect upon the concept of generativity theoretically and practically, such as rules, temporality, authorship, emergence and processes.

**Get some inspiration here**
- [Generative Design - sketches](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/), [soure code](https://github.com/generative-design/Code-Package-p5.js)
- [GenArt (with source code)](https://github.com/JosephFiola/GenArt) by JosephFiola, see ch.1-4
- [Open Processing with the search keyword 'generative'](https://www.openprocessing.org/browse/?q=generative&time=anytime&type=all#)
- [John Conway's Game of Life](http://web.stanford.edu/~cdebs/GameOfLife/)

**Tasks:**
1. Make sure you have read the text by Winnie Soon and watched the video lecture by Marius Watz: 
  - [1 hr video] [Beautiful Rules: Generative models of creativity](https://vimeo.com/26594644) (2007) by Marius Watz
  - Soon, Winnie. [Executing Liveness](http://siusoon.net/home/me/doc/soon_PhD_FINAL.pdf). PhD dissertation. Aarhus University, 2016. 82-90  (the section on Generativity)
2. Start with a blank paper. Think of at least three simple rules that you want to implement in a generative program.
3. Based on the rules in step 2, then design a generative program that utlizes at least one for-loop/while-loop and one conditional statement. (You may also consider to use noise() and random() syntax)
4. Upload your sketch to your own Github account under a folder called **mini_ex6**. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser, and if it requires downloading other library, please specify in your readme file) 
5. Create a readme file (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex6 directory (see [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing the README). The readme file should contain the followings:
- A screenshot of your program
- A URL link to your program and run on a browser, see: https://rawgit.com/.
- What are the rules in your generative program and describe how your program performs over time.
- How does this mini-exericse help you to understand what might be generativity? (see the above - objective 3)
6. Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" on his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"

NB!: Feel Free to explore and experiment more syntax.

**What is peer-feedback?**
1. First you describe what is the work, what are the elements in the work? like what you have seen, what you have experienced and what syntax he/she has used.
2. What is the emphasis? What does the work express? What does this work say or mean to you? How would you interprete the work?
3. Do you like this program, and Why? and which aspect do you like the most? 
4. Provide suggestion for improvement or expansion of the program/thoughts
