# Weekly mini ex4: due week 10, Monday night - feedback machines

**Objective:**
- To reflect upon cybernetics in digital culture via the feedback operation of input and output. 
- To experiment various data input, including audio, mouse, keyboard and web camera. 

**Tasks:**
1. Make sure you have read the text by Edward A Shanken: 
- Shanken, Edward A. ["From Cybernetics to Telematics."](https://issuu.com/xixkoo/docs/91723085-from-cybernetics-to-telema) *Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness.* Eds. Edward A. S. University of Carlifornia Press, 2003. 18-51. (start with CYBERNETICS) 
2. Experiment various data input and interactive devices, such as audio, mouse, keyboard, web camera, etc.
3. Take a look at some projects that express the concept of feedback loop [here](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/feedback-machines-mis-using-technology-non-linear-behavioural-systems/) for inspiration. 
4. Develop a sketch that expresses the essense of cybernetics, including the regulation of the flow of information via feedback loops. 
5. Upload your program/result to your own Github account under a folder called **mini_ex4**. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser, and if it requires downloading other library or other devices, please specify in your readme file) 
6. Create a readme file (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex4 directory (see [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing the README). The readme file should contain the followings:
- A screenshot of your program
- A URL link to your program and run on a browser, see: https://rawgit.com/.
- Try to use the concept of cybernetics to describe your work both conceptually and technically. 
- Can you mention and discuss one of the experiences of cybernetics in digital culture?
7. Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" on his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"

NB!: Feel Free to explore and experiment more syntax/data input devices.

**What is peer-feedback?**
1. First you describe what is the work, what are the elements in the work? like what you have seen, what you have experienced and what syntax he/she has used.
2. What is the emphasis? What does the work express? What does this work say or mean to you? How would you interprete the work?
3. Do you like this program, and Why? and which aspect do you like the most? 
4. Provide suggestion for improvement or expansion of the program/thoughts
