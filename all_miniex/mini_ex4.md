# Weekly mini ex4: due week 10, Monday night - Capture All

**Objective:**
- To critically reflect upon the activity of data capture in digital culture. 
- To experiment various data capturing inputs, including audio, mouse, keyboard and web camera.

**Tasks:**
1. Make sure you have read the text by Søren Pold + Carolin and Anne: 
  - Pold, Søren. "Button." Software Studies\ a lexicon. Eds. Matthew Fuller. MIT Press, 2008. 31-36.(can access via e-library)
  - Gerlitz, Carolin, and Anne Helmond. “The like Economy: Social Buttons and the Data-Intensive Web.” New Media & Society 15, no. 8 (December 1, 2013): 1348–65. (can access via e-library)
 
 *The focus on a botton is just an example, you can apply the similar thinking to other kinds of tracking objects, such as face, mouse, audio, etc.*
 
2. Experiment various data capturing input and interactive devices, such as audio, mouse, keyboard, web camera, etc.
3. Develop a sketch that response loosely to the open call "[CAPTURE ALL](https://transmediale.de/content/call-for-works-2015)' from Transmediale 2015 that acts as the guideline for this mini exercise. (Imagine you are submitting a sketch/an artwork/a critical or speculative design work to Transmediale, hoping your sketch will be selected in the forthcoming exhibition. It is not a usual 'design brief' as you normally see with clear 'instructions' but it requires more conceptual thinking.)
4. Upload your program/result to your own Github account under a folder called mini_ex4. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser, and if it requires downloading other library or other devices, please specify in your readme file)
5. Create a readme file (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex3 directory (see [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing the README). The readme file should contain the followings:
- A screenshot of your program
- A URL link to your program and run on a browser, see: https://rawgit.com/.
- Describe about your sketch and explains what have been captured both conceptually and technically.
- How might this ex helps you to think about or understand the data capturing process in digital culture? 
6. Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" on his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"

NB!: Feel Free to explore and experiment more syntax.

**What is peer-feedback?**
1. First you describe what is the work, what are the elements in the work? like what you have seen, what you have experienced and what syntax he/she has used.
2. What is the emphasis? What does the work express? What does this work say or mean to you? How would you interprete the work?
3. Do you like this program, and Why? and which aspect do you like the most? 
4. Provide suggestion for improvement or expansion of the program/thoughts
