# Weekly mini ex10: due week 16, Sun midnight - Draft synopsis

In order to prepare for the [final project](https://github.com/AUAP/AP2018_Submission/tree/master/Final_Project) submission, this mini exercise is considered as a means towards this final goal.

**Tasks:**
1. This mini exercise is a group work, which is the same as your final project group. 
2. Prepare a max 4 pages of synopsis that describes your final project idea - both technically and conceptually. What might be the problem of concern that you want to address in your final project? 
3. You need to submit a draft flow chart and a reference list (on top of the written 4 pages). 
4. Submit your draft in one single PDF format 
5. Submission channel: https://github.com/AUAP/AP2018_Submission. 
- Create a group folder under the existing one-“Final_Project” e.g Group1, Group2 …
- For draft submission: create a **draft** folder under your group folder.
- The folder structure should be: Final_Project/GroupX/Draft/groupX_draft.pdf (where x is your group number)
6. Provide peer-feedback according to the email notification that you will receive on the 23 Apr (Monday) by 24 Apr. Feedback your peers by creating "issues" on the github repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on draft final project-Group(X) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"
(adjust the peer-feedback accordingly as this time you are not feedback the actual code/program, but something in a written form as a concept. The departure question would be: 

-What is the focus of the project? What does the group want to address? Is it specific enough to unfold the project/concept clearly?
-Is the draft cleared to you (in terms of identifying/exploring the problems, addressing the specific theme of the course and how to use the readings)?
- Can you get a sense of how their program would work through their flow chart and description?
- Are there enough critical thoughts towards the reading(s)? What is the voice of the writers regarding the theoretical materials that they bring forward to the synopsis?
- What are the new or original perspectives that this piece (both writing and program) brings to you?
- Which part do you like the most and what might be the weakness of the synopsis?
- Do you have any suggestion to improve for the group?
