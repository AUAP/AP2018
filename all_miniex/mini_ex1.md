# Weekly mini ex1: due week 7, Monday night - Your first program

**Objective:**
- To learn the basic setup, including independent study of code syntax, uploading files on github, creating a readme file, etc. 
- To get familiar with the building and feedback process of weekly mini exercises

**Tasks:**
1. Make sure you have read/watch the required readings/videos
2. Study at least one syntax from the list of p5.js' [reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) (of course, it is always good to know more different syntax. Be curious!)
3. Familiar yourself with the reference structure: example, description, syntax and parameters (This becomes your essential and life-long skills for learning new syntax on your own)
4. Read and modify the sample code (the most basic level is changing the numbers), and produce a new sketch.
5. Upload your program/result to your own Github account under a folder called **mini_ex1**. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser) 
6. Create a readme file (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex1 directory (see [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing the README). The readme file should contain the followings:
- A screenshot about your program
- A URL link to your program and run on a browser, see: https://rawgit.com/
- Describe your first independent coding process
- How do you feel about read and write code? What might be the potential and possibilitiby of coding practice?
7. Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" on his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"

NB!: Feel Free to explore and experiment more syntax

**What is peer-feedback?**
1. First you describe what is the work, what are the elements in the work? like what you have seen, what you have experienced and what syntax he/she has used.
2. What is the emphasis? What does the work express? What does this work say or mean to you? How would you interpretate the work?
3. Do you like this program, and Why? and which aspect do you like the most? 
4. Provide suggestion for improvement or expansion of the program
