# Weekly mini ex1: due week 7 - Your first program

**Objective:**
To learn the basic setup, including independent study of code syntax, uploading files on github, creating a readme file, etc. 

**Tasks:**
1. Make sure you have read/watch the required readings/videos
2. Study one syntax from the list of p5.js' [reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)
3. Familiar yourself with the reference structure: example, description, syntax and parameters (This becomes your essential and life-long skills for learning new syntax on your own)
4. Modify the sample code (the most basic level is changing the numbers) and produce a new sketch.
5. Upload your program/result to your own Github account under a folder called mini_ex1. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser) 
6. Create a readme file (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex1 directory (see [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing the README). The readme file should contain the followings:
- A screenshot about your program
- Describe your coding process
-
