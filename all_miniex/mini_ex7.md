# Weekly mini ex7: due week 13, Monday night - e-literature

**Objectives:**
1. To design and implement an electronic literature that utilizes written text/audio text as the main medium. 
2. To reflect upon the aesthetics of code and language.
3. To learn to code collaboratively.

**Get some inspiration here with different e-lit projects**
- [e-lit collection1](http://collection.eliterature.org/1/)
- [e-lit collection2](http://collection.eliterature.org/2/)
- [e-lit collection3](http://collection.eliterature.org/3/)
- [Digital Poetry by David Jhave Johnston](http://glia.ca/)
- [Poems by Ian Hatcher](http://ianhatcher.net/#!/poems)
- [Rita library](http://rednoise.org/rita/) by Daniel Howe (you need to make sure you have time to experiment with the library)

**Tasks:**
1. This is a group mini exercise. Form a group of 2 (max 3)
2. Make sure you have read the text by Geoff Cox and Alex McLean: 
- Cox, Geoff and McLean, Alex. Speaking Code. MIT Press, 2013. 17-38. (check blackboard - ch.1 Vocable Code)
3. Work together in a group, and design and Develop an electronic literature 
4. Upload your group e-lit to each individual Github account under a folder called **mini_ex7**. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser, and if it requires downloading other library or other devices, please specify in your readme file) 
5. Create a readme file together (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex7 directory (see [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing the README). The readme file should contain the followings:
- Who are you collaborate with?
- A screenshot of your program
- A title of your program
- A URL link to your program and run on a browser, see: https://rawgit.com/.
- Analyze your own e-lit work by using the text 'Vocable Code': what is the aesthetic aspects of your program in particular to the relationship between code and language? 
6. Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" on his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"

NB!: Feel Free to explore and experiment more syntax.

**What is peer-feedback?**
1. First you describe what is the work, what are the elements in the work? like what you have seen, what you have experienced and what syntax he/she has used.
2. What is the emphasis? What does the work express? What does this work say or mean to you? How would you interprete the work?
3. Do you like this program, and Why? and which aspect do you like the most? 
4. Provide suggestion for improvement or expansion of the program/thoughts
