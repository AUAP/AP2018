# Weekly mini ex3: due week 9, Monday night - Design a Throbber differently

**Objective:**
- To reflect upon time and temporality in digital culture via the famous visual throbber icon. 
- To experiment various computational effects of animation and transformation.

**Tasks:**
1. Make sure you have read the text by Winnie Soon and Jason Farman: 
  - Soon, Winnie. ["Executing Micro-temporality."](http://www.data-browser.net/pdf/DB06_Executing_Practices.pdf)*Executing Practices*. Eds. Helen P, Eric S and Magda T.Carver. Autonomedia, 2017. 89-102.
  - Farman, Jason. [Fidget Spinners](http://reallifemag.com/fidget-spinners/). *Real Life*, 2017.
2. Study the syntaxes that have been discussed in class, and then redesign an **animated** throbber.
3. Upload your program/result to your own Github account under a folder called **mini_ex3**. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser) 
4. Create a readme file (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex3 directory (see [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing the README). The readme file should contain the followings:
- A screenshot of your program
- A URL link to your program and run on a browser, see: https://rawgit.com/.
- Describe about your throbber design, both conceptually and technically.
- What is the time-related syntax/function that you have used in your program? and why you use in this way?
- Think about a throbber that you have encounted in digital culture e.g streaming video on YouTube or loading latest feeds on Facebook or waiting a ticket transaction, what do you think a throbber tells us, or hide, about? 
5. Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" on his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"

NB!: Feel Free to explore and experiment more syntax.

**What is peer-feedback?**
1. First you describe what is the work, what are the elements in the work? like what you have seen, what you have experienced and what syntax he/she has used.
2. What is the emphasis? What does the work express? What does this work say or mean to you? How would you interprete the work?
3. Do you like this program, and Why? and which aspect do you like the most? 
4. Provide suggestion for improvement or expansion of the program/thoughts
