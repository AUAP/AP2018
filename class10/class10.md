#### Artwork showcase
[Google will eat itself](http://www.gwei.org/index.php) (2005) by UBERMORGEN, Alessandro Ludovico and Paolo Cirio 

"One of Google's main revenue generators is the "Adsense" program: It places hundreds of thousands of little Google text-ads on websites around the world.

Now we have set up a vast amount of such Adsense-Accounts for our hidden Web-Sites. Each time someone visits a Web-Sites within our network of sites, he/she triggers a series of robots. For each click we receive a micropaiment from Google.

Google pays us monthly by check. Each time we collect enough money, we buy the next Google share.

GWEI - Google Will Eat Itself is to show-case and unveil a total monopoly of information, a weakness of the new global advertisment system and the renaissance of the “new economic bubble" - reality is, Google is currently valued more than all Swiss Banks together (sic)."

More different flowcharts [here](http://www.gwei.org/pages/diagram/diagram.html) 

##### Discussion
- Find out how GWEI works
- What's the role of flow charts here in their work? 

#### What are algorithms?

Bernoulli number ‘algorithm’, Ada Lovelace, 1843 (One of the world first algorithms) 

From Ed Finn: 

**Computer Science perspective (p. 17-18)**: 
- An algorithm is a recipe, an instruction set, a sequence of tasks to achieve a particular calculation or result.
- [An] engineer's notion of algorithms geared toward defining problems and solutions

**Cultural perspective (p. 15-16, 47)**: 
- Algorithms performs many other kinds of cultural work (e.g suggesting potential mates, books and booking vocations)
- Algorithms function as culture machines
- By learning to interpret the container, the inputs and outputs, the seams of implementation, we can begin to develop a way of reading algorithms as culture machines that operate in the gap between code and culture. 
- The most important aspect of an algorithmic system is not the surface material it presents to the world at any particular moment [...] but rather the system of rules and agents that constantly generate and manipulate that surface material.

#### Flow Chart? 

“[A flow chart] shows the constraints on the system, its system boundaries and the general flow of information around the system. It is a common means of understanding complex data flows around a system within computer science and software engineering…
Flowcharts are very simple diagnostic and modeling structures that follow the logic of the program through a series of linear processes with decision gates, where a yes or no answer is expected, to guide the software to a certain resolution or output.”  (Berry 2011, pp. 113-114)
  
Practically: A flowchart is a diagram that shows the **breakdown of a task** or system into all of the necessary steps. Each step is represented by a symbol and connecting lines show **the step-by-step progression** through the task.

##### in-class ex: draw a flow chart based on below code
```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowheight);
  var sometext = ['h','e','l','l','o'];
  for (var i=0;i<sometext.length; i++) {
    console.log(sometext[i]);
  }
}
```

A flow chart shows a breakdown of tasks representing procedures, step-by-step progression and algorithms. It is not a detailed flow chart that includes every possible computational steps but rather it demonstrates high-level processes for **visual understanding** that gives a general idea of how tasks are broken down. It is independent of any programming language as it **concerns procedures** but not coding syntax.
