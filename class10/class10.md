[Google will eat itself](http://www.gwei.org/index.php) (2005) by UBERMORGEN, Alessandro Ludovico and Paolo Cirio 

"One of Google's main revenue generators is the "Adsense" program: It places hundreds of thousands of little Google text-ads on websites around the world.

Now we have set up a vast amount of such Adsense-Accounts for our hidden Web-Sites. Each time someone visits a Web-Sites within our network of sites, he/she triggers a series of robots. For each click we receive a micropaiment from Google.

Google pays us monthly by check. Each time we collect enough money, we buy the next Google share.

GWEI - Google Will Eat Itself is to show-case and unveil a total monopoly of information, a weakness of the new global advertisment system and the renaissance of the â€œnew economic bubble" - reality is, Google is currently valued more than all Swiss Banks together (sic)."
