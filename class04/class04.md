### The theme about Data Capture

See [here](https://www.slashgear.com/facebook-investigates-tracking-users-cursors-and-screen-behavior-30303663/)

Facebook has the ability to track unposted status updates (what you are typing as you're typing, regardless it is a published/public post or not)

### The concept of Data Capture (my own notes)
Pold - Button in Software Studies
- buttons as interfaces (as part of GUI and mechanical electronic interface)
- button can be textualized, styled, reactive, sonified...
- different types of button: click button, radio botton
- "a potential for interaction" p.31 (what if a botton cannot interact?)
- click button - mouse click 
- "a functional control" p.31
    - well defined, predictable
- not only about design and function, but buttons with history and culture. 
- meaning: what has been mobilized? (call for action - advertising)
- buttons: force decision in a binary choice (p.34)
    -accept/cancel, yes/no
    -sometimes not even a selection of choice, is also about exclusion with only 1 option apparently. To download, or else you don't click on it. 
    - no betweenness
 - buttonization => "our reality becomes clickable" (p. 36)
 
 Gerlitz and Helmond: 2013
 - like economy: trade, metrics, tracking
 - role of social buttons
 - "turned into valuable consumer data and enter multiple cycles of multiplication and exchange" (p.2)
 - "the like botton's capacity to instantly metrify and intensify user affects - turning them into numbers on the Like counter- while fostering further user engagement to multiply and scale up user data" (p. 3)
 - linking practices (web 1.0) then creating connections between websites e.g social buttons
 - liking => social activity that can be performed (p. 5)
 - "introduction of social plugings, including the external Like button, to enable a personalied, social experience of the web." (p.5)
 - like button -> generate data (production of browsing behaviors) via cookies
 - maximize the data flow to the platform
 - foster user engagement adn traffic: like button (p. 7)
 - apps vs websites
 - "provides a one-click shortcut to express a variety of affective response" (p. 11)
 - "It value lies both in the present and in the future, in the plus one it adds to the Like counter and the number of x potential more likes, comments, shares or other responses it might generate within the platform" (p. 12)
 - "rendering cross-syndication more scalable" (p. 12)
 - Within the like economy, data and numbers have performative and productive capacities, they can generate user affects, enact more activities and thus multiply themselves (p. 13)
