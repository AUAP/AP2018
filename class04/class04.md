### The theme about Data Capture

See [here](https://www.slashgear.com/facebook-investigates-tracking-users-cursors-and-screen-behavior-30303663/)

Facebook has the ability to track unposted status updates (what you are typing as you're typing, regardless it is a published/public post or not)

### The concept of Data Capture (my own notes)
Pold - Button in Software Studies
- buttons as interfaces (as part of GUI and mechanical electronic interface)
- button can be textualized, styled, reactive, sonified...
- different types of button: click button, radio botton
- "a potential for interaction" p.31 (what if a botton cannot interact?)
- click button - mouse click 
- "a functional control" p.31
    - well defined, predictable
- not only about design and function, but buttons with history and culture. 
- meaning: what has been mobilized? (call for action - advertising)
- buttons: force decision in a binary choice (p.34)
    -accept/cancel, yes/no
    -sometimes not even a selection of choice, is also about exclusion with only 1 option apparently. To download, or else you don't click on it. 
    - no betweenness
 - buttonization => "our reality becomes clickable" (p. 36)
