#### Vocable Code (2017) by Winnie Soon

Vocable Code is both a work of “software art” (software as artwork, not software to make an artwork) and a “codework” (where the source code and critical writing operate together) produced to embody “queer code”. It examines the notion of queerness in computer coding. Through collecting voices and statements from others that help to complete the sentence that begins: “Queer is…”, the work is computationally and poetically composed where the texts and voices are repeated and disrupted by mathematical chaos, creating a dynamic audio-visual literature and exploring the performativity of code, subjectivity and language. Behind the executed web interface, the code itself is deliberately written as a codework, a mix of a computer programming language and human language, exploring the material and linguistic tensions of writing and reading within the context of (non)binary poetry and computer code.

#### Conceptual discussion on Vocable Code 
```
Go through the notes that you have taken, then go through the runme and readme of Vocable Code.
Discussion: 
What are voices? 
Can you draw a relation between the two pieces based on the notes that you have written? 
```
**Instructions:**
1.	Find a blank paper and prepare to write a sentence.
2.	Complete the sentence with the starting words: “Queer is…”
  - Each sentence contains no more than 5 words (the starting words- “queer is” is not included)
  -	More than 1 sentence is allowed but not more than 3.
  -	English word/sentence is required.
  -	It is ok to have just one word.
3.	Download/Locate a voice recording app on your smartphone (e.g “Voice Recorder” on Android phone or “Voice Memos app” on iphone)
4.	Try to find a quiet environment and record your voice, and see if the app works (controlling the start and end of the recording button).
5.	Prepare to record your voice with your written sentence(s).
  -	It is up to you to decide the temporality and rhythm of speaking the text.
  -	It is up to you to either speak the full word or full sentence with different pitch/tempo/rhythm.
  -	You can also speak on a certain part (phonetics) of the word or sentence. In other words, the word/sentence doesn’t need to be fully pronounced. 
  -	The first two provided words “queer is” can be omitted. 
6.	Record your voice, and each voice file holds one sentence only.
