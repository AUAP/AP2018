## OUTLINE:  
“[Aesthetic Programming](http://darc.au.dk/research/research-agenda/aesthetic-programming/)” is a practice-oriented course requires no prior programming experience but with an interest in using code to explore the relationship between art, design, technology and culture within the context of software studies. The course introduces computer coding as an aesthetic, expressive, creative and critical endeavour beyond its functional application. It explores coding as a practice of reading, writing and building, as well as thinking with and in the world, and understanding the complex computational procedures that underwrite our experiences and realities in digital culture. Through coding practice, students are able to contextualize, conceptualize, articulate, design, build, write and run a piece of software. Emphasis is placed on the student acquiring practical skills of expression through an introduction to programming, and this course uses [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) primarily, which serves as a foundation for further courses on Digital Design.   
  
The course is designed to complement the parallel course in SOFTWARE STUDIES where further critical work will be developed and expanded but without losing sight of coding as critical work in itself. Examples of artists and designers will be introduced that work with coding as their expressive material.   

## TASKS:   
1. Weekly mini exercises (mostly individual with a few group works) + peer feedback 
2. [Peer-tutoring/Peer-feedback](https://github.com/AUAP/AP2018_Submission): within 20 mins in-class presentation with respondents 
3. Active participation in class discussion and exercises
4. [FINAL group project](https://github.com/AUAP/AP2018_Submission/tree/master/Final_Project) - in the form of a “readme” and a “runme” (software) packaged + in class presentation 
5. Oral exam (Date: to be confirmed)

!NB: 20 ECTS is equivalent to around 25 hours per week, including lecture and tutorial. As such, you are required to spend around 20 hours per week in reading and programming. The more you practice everyday, the more you get out of the course. There is no short cut and the best way is to PRACTICE!

## Other learning support environment:
1. Weekly 2 hours tutorial session (every Wed - Mandatory)
2. Weekly 4 hours shut up+code or code study group discussion (every Friday 08.00-12.00- Optional in 5361-144)

## LEARNING OUTCOMES:
1. Learn foundamental concepts in computer programming, such as abstraction, structure, function, iteration, variables and arrays, conditional statements, objects, feedback and interactivity.
2. Acquire ability to design, read and write processes via computer code and build/develop computational artefacts.
3. Integrate practical and theoretical skills to articulte and conceptualize computational artefacts.
4. Recognize coding practice as a way of thinking and inquiry to understand wider cultural systems (computational thinking).

## NOTES for mini exercises:
- You are advised to spend at least 10 hours on the weekly mini exercises or coding. 
- If the mini exercises are too simple, feel free to program something more complex and advance by exploring other syntax.
- But it is absolutely fine if the program is a simple one and not having a "well designed" screen. 
- It is important to address all the questions in the mini exercise, as they help you to understand the subject matter both technically and conceptually.
- Make use of your peers to learn different syntax, functions and operators and to ask questions.
- The more you practice, the more you will get out of the course. 
- The aims of having weekly mini exercises are to encourage experimentation, practice programming and stimulate thinking, therefore there is no grade for this.
- Make sure the sketch folder contains necessary libraries, files and a correct directory. It should be able to run on a github server through a web browser. 
- In general, the mini ex needs to submit on github on Monday (before the lecture), and peer-feedback should be done on Tue (before the Wed tutorial class)
- It is mandatory to submit weekly mini exercises and to provide feedback to your peers. Those who fails to do any of them may incur a penalty of absence in one class. 

## RULES: (in relation to Exam A)
1. To pass the participation requirement and to enter Exam A, you need to attend at least 75% of the course including guest lectures which means you can only skip maximum 3 lecture classes **and** 3 tutorials. 
2. Weekly mini exercises (together with written peer-feedback) is considered as part of the course participation. For those who fail to submit their work may incur a penalty of absence in one class. 
3. You need to submit your final project with the runme, readme as well as having a presentation to the class at the last lecture.

      - In particular the syntax that you are presenting
      - You can also refer to the first class's assigned texts on computational thinking/why program/coding literacy
    - You may consider to have sample/creative code or simple code exercise for the class.  
    - You can also make use of collaborative tools e.g  code jam/live coding with teletype on Atom
