## OUTLINE:  
“Aesthetic Programming” is a practice-oriented course requires no prior programming experience but with an interest in using code to explore the relationship between art, design, technology and culture within the context of software studies. The course introduces computer coding as an aesthetic, creative and critical endeavour beyond its functional application. It explores coding as a practice of reading, writing and building, as well as thinking with and in the world, and understanding the complex computational procedures that underwrite our experiences and realities in digital culture. Through coding practice, students are able to contextualize, conceptualize, articulate, design, build, write and run a piece of software. Emphasis is placed on the student acquiring practical skills of expression through an introduction to programming, and this course uses [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) primarily, which serves as a foundation for further courses on Digital Design.   
  
The course is designed to complement the parallel course in SOFTWARE STUDIES where further critical work will be developed and expanded but without losing sight of coding as critical work in itself. Examples of artists and designers will be introduced that work with coding as their expressive material.   

## TASKS:   
1. Weekly mini exercises (mostly individual with a few group works) + peer feedback 
2. Peer-tutoring/Peer-feedback: within 20 mins in-class presentation with respondents 
3. Active participation in class discussion and exercises
4. FINAL group project - in the form of a “readme” and a “runme” (software) packaged + in class presentation 
5. Oral exam (Date: to be confirmed)

!NB: 20 ECTS is equivalent to around 25 hours per week, including lecture and tutorial. As such, you are required to spend around 20 hours per week in reading and programming. The more you practice everyday, the more you get out of the course. There is no short cut and the best way is to PRACTICE!

## Other learning support environment:
1. Weekly 2 hours tutorial session (every Wed - Mandatory)
2. Weekly 4 hours shut up+code or code study group discussion (every Friday 10.00-14.00- Optional in 5361-144)

## LEARNING OUTCOMES:
1. Learn basic concepts in computer programming, such as structures, functions, drawing, arrays, conditional statements, objects, and interactivity.
2. Acquire ability to design, read, write and build/develop computational artefacts.
3. Integrate practical and theoretical skills to articulte and conceptualize computational artefacts.
4. Recognize coding practice as a way of thinking and inquiry to understand wider cultural systems (computational thinking).

## NOTES for mini exercises:
- You are advised to at least spend 10 hours on the weekly mini exercises or coding. 
- If the mini exercises are too simple, feel free to program something more complex and advance by exploring other syntax.
- But it is absolutely fine if the program is a simple one and not having a "well designed" screen. 
- It is important to address all the questions in the mini exercise, as they help you to understand the subject matter both technically and conceptually.
- Make use of your peers to learn different syntax, functions and operators and to ask questions.
- The more you practice, the more you will get out of the course. 
- The aims of having weekly mini exercises are to encourage experimentation, practice programming and stimulate thinking, therefore there is no grade for this.
- Make sure the sketch folder contains necessary libraries, files and a correct directory. It should be able to run on a github server through a web browser. 
- In general, the mini ex needs to submit on github on Monday (before the lecture), and peer-feedback should be done on Tue (before the tutorial class)
- It is mandatory to submit weekly mini exercises and to provide feedback to your peers. Those who fails to do any of them may incur a penalty of absence in one class. 

## Peer tutoring/ respondents format

-  Within 15-20 mins presentation (peer tutoring)
    - Technical understanding (provide sample code)
    - Teaching (able to describe/speak about code with your language)
    - Articulation (able to apply and elaborate on how you do it, your process)
    - Send your slides to the respondents a day before the class. i.e on Monday.
- Within 10 mins response by respondents (feedback and ask questions)
  - Demonstrate your understanding of the assigned theme
  - Set some questions in mind and lead the discussion

## RULES:
1. To pass the participation requirement and to enter Exam A, you need to attend at least 75% of the course which means you can only skip maximum 3 classes and 3 tutorials. 
2. Weekly mini exercises (together with peer-feedback) is part of the course participation, those who fail to submit their work may incur a penalty of absence in one class.
