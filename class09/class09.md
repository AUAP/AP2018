#### Google API walkthrough- in-class ex
![image](https://github.com/AUAP/AP2018/blob/master/class09/flowers.gif)
- Basic: The sample code is about getting a static image from Google image search API (via parsing JSON), and then display it on a screen. This requires you to:
1. Understand the Google image search API workflow
2. Understand the API specification
3. Understand the corresponding returned JSON file format from Google image search API
4. Able to get the API key and search engine ID from Google
5. Configure the settings at the Google image search console
- Advanced: Uncomment line 35-42, where you will get the effects in which the image color of the image will be picked up and presented as animated lines.
```javascript
img.loadPixels();
img_x = floor(random(0,img.width));
img_y = floor(random(0,img.height));
loc = (img_x+img_y * img.width)*4; //which pixel of the image (and each pixel array holds red, green, blue and alpha values)
stroke(color(img.pixels[loc],img.pixels[loc + 1], img.pixels[loc+2]));
line(img_x,0,img_x,height);
```

#### Step by Step:
1. [Basic] Create a p5 sketch, then copy and paste the [source code](https://github.com/AUAP/AP2018/blob/master/class09/sketch09/sketch09.js) to your code editor. (you need to have a html file and the p5 library.
2. [Basic] The objective is to replace the the API on line 7
```javascript
var apikey = "INPUT YOUR OWN KEY"; 
```
![image4](https://github.com/AUAP/AP2018/blob/master/class09/image4.png)
- Go to [Custom Search JSON/Atom API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview)
- click the blue botton “Get A Key” -> Create project -> Enter your project name (e.g miniEx9) -> Click 'Create and Enable API’ -> Copy your API key and paste on your program > line 7.

3. [Basic] After you get the API key, next is to replace the search engine ID (cx) on line 8
```javascript
var engineID = "INPUT YOUR OWN";
```
![image5](https://github.com/AUAP/AP2018/blob/master/class09/image5.png)

- Get the search engine ID (CX) [here](https://cse.google.com/all)
- Add search engine -> Put something in “Sites to search” (e.g http://www.google.com) and “Name of the search engine” (e.g miniEx9) -> Click ‘create’; “Details” with ‘Search Engine ID’ 
- Copy the ID (that is the cx) and paste on your program > line 8. 

4. [Basic] Settings on the control panel:
- select “search the entire web but emphasize included sites” 
- Make sure the “Image Search” is ON > click **update**

5. [Basic] Try to run your program and see if any image display on your screen (turn your browser console on)

6. [Basic] How to get the exact data? 
```javascript
function fetchImage() {
	request = url + "key=" + apikey + "&cx=" + engineID + "&imgSize=" + imgSize + "&q=" + query;
	console.log(request);
	loadJSON(request, gotData); //this is the key syntax and line of code to make a query request and get a query response
}

function gotData(data) {   //a callback needs an argument
	getImg = data.items[0].pagemap.cse_thumbnail[0].src;  // this is the thumbnail
}
```
![image6](https://github.com/AUAP/AP2018/blob/master/class09/image6.png)

7. [Basic] I want to search for other keywords or other image format.
- Change your query on line 10, right now the keywords is warhol flowers. The program won't take space between text, please use '+' sign to join the text. 
```javascript
var query = "warhol+flowers"; //search keywords
```
- look at [here](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/reference/cse/list#parameters) to change different parameters, such as image size or add imgColorType etc. 
- The whole URL is as below, and there is a total of 100 free requests and each parameter is seperated by a '&' sign 
https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=YOURKEY&cx=YOURID&imgSize=small&q=warhol+flowers


8. [Advanced] If you want to work with the advanced code, you need:
- uncomment line 35-42
- if you are using Google chrome, please install an extra add on and then restart the browser and turn it on: [Allow-Control-Allow-Original:*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en) (it is because the image is hosted with different domain, the current browser does not allow you to manipulate an image in this way. You can either install this add on or do server side programming like using node.js)
- It seems working fine on Firefox (at least for my browser), perhaps you may need to restart the browser
- You should able to load the image and with the animated effects, but still you should encounter 'Type Error' on your browser console. It is because The image is not in preload function and it is generated on the fly, and it takes time to load the image and get the pixel color value. I have used the '[try and catch statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch)' to keep the code running over time (it is a javasript syntax)
```javascript
try {	//takes time to load the external image
	loadImage(getImg, function(img) {
	image(img,0,0);
	//try to uncomment this block if you manage to get the image. 
	img.loadPixels();
	img_x = floor(random(0,img.width));
	img_y = floor(random(0,img.height));
	loc = (img_x+img_y * img.width)*4; //which pixel of the image (and each pixel array holds red, green, blue and alpha values), can see more here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUMZ5YRxHI
	stroke(color(img.pixels[loc],img.pixels[loc + 1], img.pixels[loc+2])); //rgb values
	line(img_x,0,img_x,height);		
	});
}catch(error) {
  	console.error(error);
}
```

9. Checking out different errors:
At this stage, your program will be more complex. You need to develop a way to identify errors. The error is from your own writing of the program, or error from parsing the data, or error from Google. Is it syntactic  FOr example, if you encounter error 403 in your console, this likely means that Google has barred your API as the requests exceed the 100 times. 

In a broad sense, errors can be categorized in three types:

A. **Syntax errors**: problems with the syntax, also known as parsing errors. -> easier to catch and can be detected by a parser (i.e the browser in this case) e.g spelling errors or missing a closed bracket
```javascript
SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
```
B. **Runtime errors**: It happens during the execution of a program and it can cause a program to terminate unexpectedly if an exception is not thrown while the syntax is correct. That is why it is also called exceptions. (e.g TypeError or ReferenceError in Firefox browser)
```javascript
TypeError: str is undefined
ReferenceError: hello is not defined
```  
C. **Logical errors**: Arguably the hardest error to locate as it deals with logics but not syntax. The code may still run perfectly but the result is not what you expected. 
  - try to identify where errors might occur, down to block of code or line of code
  - try to identify type errors
  - Use [Try/Catch/Finally/Throw an exception](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_errors.asp) 


#### Tasks for next week
- miniEx8 - [Group work: Working with APIs](https://github.com/AUAP/AP2018/blob/master/all_miniex/miniex8.md)
- Peer-tutoring: Group 7 / Respondents: Group 8, Topic: Your coding challenge
- Peer-tutoring: Group 8 / Respondents: Group 9, Topic: Your coding challenge
	- Think of a syntax that you think would be good for your peers to know
	- Prepare a sample code/ex that help the class to understand it
	- Or you may want to discuss any aspect of the code or suggest an approach to help solving problems.
