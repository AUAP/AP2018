## Intro
- Why do you think you need to know programming? Why is it important to know programming in the area of digital design?
- The three assigned reading in class00:
    - 1 hr video lecture: **Computational Thinking and Thinking About Computing by Jeannette M. Wing (2009)**
      - She is a professor of Computer Science, and the presentation is more from a science perspective (computer science/mathematics) and for other science discliplines e.g biology, statistics, astronomy, neurosciences, etc or for scientific analysis purposes.
      - CT "complements and combines mathematics and engineering thinking"
      - key concepts: computational thinking, abstraction (two levels), tools, efficiency
      - STEM vs [STEAM](https://educationcloset.com/steam/what-is-steam/)
      - What might be computational arts/design? 
    - **Montfort, Nick. Exploratory Programming For the Arts and Humanities. MIT Press, 2016. 267-277** (check blackboard - Appendix A: Why Program?)
    - **Vee, Annette. Coding Literacty: How Computer Programming Is Changing Writing. MIT Press, 2017.43-93** (Check blackboard - 1 Coding for Everyone and the Legacy of Mass Literacy)
- What is programming and computational thinking? 
- Walkthrough the syllabus 
- forming groups
## Setting up
- What is javascript and p5.js? 
- Setting up the coding environent
  - Download the complete [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/download/) > unzip it (create your working folder, I recommend desktop)
  - A web Browser (suggest Firefox), how to open the [console window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Console_messages) (Tools > Web Developer > Web console)
  - A Code editor - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    - setup [atom-live-server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xy3yDDY4IE) for live preview of code modification on a browser | Or: Go to Preference > settings > install > type atom-live-server > install. After the installation, go to menu bar > Packages > atom-live-server > start (or use mac short cut: control + Option + L)
  - test the downloaded p5.js file under your newly created working folder
    - try to change some parameters in the sketch.js file, press save. (make sure the atom-live-server has started)
    - you should see the code is executed and something will display on your browser
 - Setting up a [Github account](http://www.github.com)
## Example showcase
## Task for next week
- Why mini exercises?
- mini exercise 01 (mini_ex01)
