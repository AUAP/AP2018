Messy notes of class06 - Generativity

Agenda:
- Artwork showcase: 
- Peer-Tutoring: conditions with sound and video files 
- The theme about Generativity
- Sample code
- Mid way evaluation
- Tasks for next week

#### Generativity

Generative art refers to any art practice where artists use a system, such as a set of natural languages, rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art. (Galanter, 2003)

Generative art refers to any art practice in which the artist cedes control to a system with functional autonomy that contributes to, or results in, a completed work of art. Systems may include natural langauge instructions, biological or chemical processes, computer programs, machines, self-organizing materials mathematical operations, and other procedural interventions. (Galanter, 2008, p. 154)

- self-organizing processes 
- Authorship


#### Notes on reading (my own notes)
Marius Watz:


- photoshop: a different tool...different way of working with images

- read/write...cannot use software passively..change the software so that it works for you

- software is not a tool..but it is also material

- generative art vs computational design

- generative art: create a system

    -> computer program, machine, robots etc

    -> external not directly connect to you

    -> autonomy is the ultimate goal

authorship: product of artist

- mode of translation, errors -> become main part of the work

- patterns -> created by change of events

- generative art

    - examine the system and process as an aesthetic object/output 

    - conceptual examination of a system

    - drawing through instructions

    - john cage: remove himself...as godauthor

    - introduce chance...

- make interesting system in real life...show some aspects of intelligent

    - semi automated creation

    - chance -> co-author

- software is always live..

    - make a system that take on taking decision on the fly

- complexity arising from simple rules

- electronic plastic number 1 ->

- show information in a system

- extended to time...get different quality

- circle packing..fitting circles.. (Packing 2007)

- complexity increases through rotation and transformation

- without intervention

- code as a method to create different forms
