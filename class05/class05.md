#### The theme about Object Orientation

- Object Oriented Programming
  - A program execution is regarded as a physical model, simulating the behavior of either a real or imaginary part of the world (Madsen et al, 1993, p.16)
  - Objects are used for representing (or modeling) physical phenomena (Madsen et al, 1993, p.18)
  - Objects are computerized material (Madsen et al, 1993, p.18)

  - A class specifies the structure of its objects' attributes and the possible behaviors of its objects.
    - like a template and blueprint of things
  - Think of an object as a specific instance
    - An object holds specific values of attributes (but these values can change over time)
    - An object has behaviors, which can perform in different ways
  - e.g1 A person with **properties** like name=winnie, haircolor=brown, wear glasses, height=165cm, favoriteColor=blue ...
  - e.g2 A person **runs** from Aarhus C to Aarhus N (run is the method- which will be defined via functions)
  - Translate into programming concepts where a program may have more than one person with the same properties but different values: 

   Person        |
  -------------  |
  Name, HairColor, withGlasses, Height, FavoriteColor, FromLocation, ToLocation|
  run()

- In-class activity: Creating and Defining Car objects
  - what might be the attributes of a car? 
  - what might be the behaviors of a car?
