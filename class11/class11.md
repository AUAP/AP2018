#### Introducing ML javascript related library
- [Teachable machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) (more focus on the training process)
- [ml5js](https://github.com/ml5js)
  - image classification [link](https://rawgit.com/AUAP/AP2018/master/class11/sketch11_imageclassifier/index.html), it is a pre-trained model based on approximately 15 million images via [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/).

  - LSTM text generation [link](https://rawgit.com/AUAP/AP2018/master/class11/sketch11_LSTMText/index.html), it is also a pre-trained model based on a corpus of Ernest Hemingway.

##### Discussion
- How could you relate your field and your life with Machine Learning?
- How does the data effect the machine learning?
- What is reading/seeing in machine learning?
- What is learning in machine learning? 
  
#### Discussion on final project + Task for this/next week:
- Weekly [mini ex10](https://github.com/AUAP/AP2018/blob/master/all_miniex/mini_ex10.md): due week 17, Sun night | Draft of synopsis
